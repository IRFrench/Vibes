## Meaning
---
Volatile Instinct-Based Estimation System

## Core Concept
---
VIBES™ is a workload priority selection system that uses the subjective “feeling” of urgency, importance, and personal readiness — while subtly biasing those feelings toward the least efficient choices possible.
Most people’s vibes are already a little off. VIBES™ leverages this human flaw, magnifying it until every choice feels “right” but is, in fact, catastrophically wrong.

## Mechanics
---

### Perception Over Reality
- Urgency scores are hidden.
- The system offers cryptic "priority signals" like "This feels like a Tuesday task" or "Your aura is telling you to delay this".
- Any objective indicators (deadlines, dependencies) are buried three menus deep.

### Emotional Misdirection
- If you’re stressed about Task A, the system will gently suggest Task B ("B is so much more inspiring right now").
- If you’re calm and ready for deep work, it suggests low-impact busywork to "warm up."

### Random Reinforcement
- Sometimes making a poor choice feels like a win. The system gives encouraging, vague praise like "That felt productive!" even if it wasn’t.

### Ever-Shifting Priorities
- The order of tasks changes each time you check the list.
- Colors and icons are altered subtly so users can’t trust their memory of what was "high priority" yesterday.

### The Vibe Disruption Algorithm™
- Based on complex but meaningless mood metrics: "current planetary alignment," "your caffeine aura," and "average Slack message sentiment."
- In reality, these inputs are noise, ensuring unpredictability.

## Why It Works (for its evil purpose)
---
- People already trust their gut over data.
- People love feeling productive even if they aren’t.
- A moving target is impossible to optimize for — keeping everyone in perpetual, low-grade chaos.

## VIBES Corporate Rebrand Timeline

The idea being that each quarter, leadership “refreshes” the meaning of the acronym so no one ever knows exactly what it stands for, creating plausible deniability and perpetual confusion.

| Quarter |	Official Backronym |	Tone & Spin |	Real Effect
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Q1 |	Vision-Inspired Business Efficiency Suite |	Launch branding. Sounds innovative, mission-driven. |	Staff are eager but can’t find the “efficiency” part. |
| Q2 |	Variable Incentive-Based Execution Strategy |	“Agile” pivot — now it’s about incentives. |	No two teams are measured the same way; chaos blooms. |
| Q3 |	Volatility-Integrated Business Engagement Solution |	Markets are “dynamic,” so the system “embraces change.” |	Priorities change daily; deliverables evaporate. |
| Q4 |	Value-Inversion for Business Excellence Standards |	Quiet admission that inversion is part of “disruption.” |	High-value projects stall while trivial work accelerates. |
| Q5 |	Visionary Intent, Baseless Evaluation System |	PR spin calls it “gut-driven leadership.” |	All metrics abandoned; feelings run the show. |
| Q6 |	Venture-Inspired Bureaucratic Enhancement Service |	“Structured innovation” phase. |	Adds more layers of approval without improving output. |
| Q7 |	Vertical Integration of Baseless Efficiency Standards |	“Enterprise-wide synergy” push. |	Uniformly poor decisions across all departments. |
| Q8 |	Vaguely Informed Business Execution Simplifier |	Claimed to make things easier. |	In practice, deletes critical details. |
